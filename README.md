golf_app
========

A golf app designed to keep stats for golfers while they are on the golf course. 
The golfer just downloads the app which will eventually by put in the app store once it has full functionality.
It will keep a dynamic list of rounds that the golfer can view at anytime.

This app will be mainly deployed to mobile phones.
*Golfers do not take a tablet or laptop to the golf course unless they are 'nuts'.

The app will eventually have special features that will enable the user to email or
print the data on an easy to read scorecard that has his/her stats displayed.

Notes - This app has most of its data hardcoded but will eventually have an sql/php database
implemented with javascript or jquery to use with the 'permanent' LocalStorage that html5 now provides help with.
